You seem to replace Your brain with your heart You take things so hard And then you fall apart You try to explain But before you can start Those cry baby tears Come out of the dark  Someone's turning the handle To that faucet in your eyes They're pouring out Where everyone can see  Your heart's too big for your body It's why it won't fit inside They're pouring out Where everyone can see  They call you cry baby, cry baby But you don't fucking care Cry baby, cry baby So you laugh through your tears Cry baby, cry baby Cause you don't fucking care Tears fall to the ground You'll just let them drown  You're all on your own and You lost all your friends You told yourself that It's not you, it's them You're one of a kind And no one understands But those cry baby tears Keep coming back again  Something's turning the handle To that faucet in your eyes They're pouring out Where everyone can see  They call you cry baby, cry baby But you don't fucking care Cry baby, cry baby So you laugh through your tears Cry baby, cry baby Cause you don't fucking care Tears fall to the ground You just let them drown  I look at you and I see myself I know you better Than anyone else I have same the faucet In my eyes So your tears are mine   They call me cry baby, cry baby But I don't fucking care Cry baby, cry baby So I laugh through my tears Cry baby, cry baby But I don't fucking care Tears fall to the ground I just let them drown I just let them drown Cry baby, cry baby


Hey girl, open the walls
Play with your dolls
We'll be a perfect family
When you walk away
Is when we really play
You don't hear me when I say
Mom, please wake up
Dad's with a slut
And your son is smoking cannabis

No one ever listens
This wallpaper glistens
Don't let them see what goes down in the kitchen


Places, places
Get in your places
Throw on your dress and put on your doll faces
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains
Picture, picture, smile for the picture
Pose with your brother, won't you be a good sister?
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains

D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E
I see things that nobody else sees
D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E
I see things that nobody else sees


Hey girl, look at my mom
She's got it going on
Ha, you're blinded by her jewelry
When you turn your back
She pulls out a flask
And forgets his infidelity
Uh oh she's coming to the attic, plastic
Go back to being plastic


No one ever listens
This wallpaper glistens
One day they'll see what goes down in the kitchen


Places, places
Get in your places
Throw on your dress and put on your doll faces
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains
Picture, picture, smile for the picture
Pose with your brother, won't you be a good sister?
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains


D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E
I see things that nobody else sees
D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E
I see things that nobody else sees


Hey girl
Hey girl, open your walls
Play with your dolls
We'll be a perfect family


Places, places
Get in your places
Throw on your dress and put on your doll faces
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains

Blood still stains when the sheets are washed
Sex don't sleep when the lights are off
Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
And syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup
He's still dead when you're done with the bottle
Of course it's a corpse that you keep in the cradle
Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
Syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup


Blood money, blood money
How did you afford this ring that I love, honey?
"Just another shift at the drug company,"
He doesn't think I'm that fucking dumb does he?
It doesn't matter what you pull up to your home
We know what goes on inside
You call that ass your own, we call that silicone
Silly girl, we're silly, boys


Blood still stains when the sheets are washed
Sex don't sleep when the lights are off
Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
And syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup
He's still dead when you're done with the bottle
Of course it's a corpse that you keep in the cradle
Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
Syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup

Sippy cup, s-s-sippy cup, in a sippy cup, sippy cup
In a sippy cup, in a sippy cup, in a sippy cup, in a sippy cup


Pill diet, pill diet, if they give you a new pill then you will buy it
If they say to kill yourself, then you will try it
All the makeup in the world, won't make you less insecure
You got weights in your pockets, when you go to the doctors
Your favorite candy's cotton, that's why all your teeth are rotten
Silly girls with silly boys


Blood still stains when the sheets are washed
Sex don't sleep when the lights are off
Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
And syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup
He's still dead when you're done with the bottle
Of course it's a corpse that you keep in the cradle
Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
Syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup


Sippy cup, s-s-sippy cup, in a sippy cup, sippy cup
In a sippy cup, in a sippy cup, in a sippy cup, in a sippy cup

Blood still stains when the sheets are washed
Sex don't sleep when the lights are off
Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
And syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup


Round and round like a horse on a carousel
We go, will I catch up to love? I can never tell
I know chasing after you is like a fairytale
But I feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel

Come, come one come all
You must be this tall
To ride this ride, at the carnival
Oh, come take my hand
And run through playland
So high, too high, at the carnival

And it's all fun and games
Till somebody falls in love
But you already bought a ticket
And there's no turning back now

Round and round like a horse on a carousel
We go, will I catch up to love? I can never tell
I know chasing after you is like a fairytale
But I feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel

This horse is too slow
We're always this close
Almost, almost
We're a freak show
Ride right when I'm near
It's like you disappear
Where'd you go?
Mr. Houdini, you're a freak show

And it's all fun and games
Till somebody falls in love
But you already bought a ticket
And there's no turning back now

Round and round like a horse on a carousel
We go, will I catch up to love? I can never tell
I know chasing after you is like a fairytale
But I feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel

Why did you steal my cotton candy heart?
You threw it in this damn coin slot
And now I'm stuck, I'm stuck
Riding, riding, riding

Round and round like a horse on a carousel
We go, will I catch up to love? I can never tell
I know chasing after you is like a fairytale
But I feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel

You're always aiming paper airplanes at me when you're around
You build me up like building blocks just so you can bring me down
You can crush my candy cane but you'll never catch me cry
If you dangle that diploma and I deck you, don't be surprised

I know my ABC's, yet you keep teaching me
I say fuck your degree, alphabet boy
You think you're smarter than me with all your bad poetry
Fuck all your ABC's, alphabet boy

I'm not a little kid now
Watch me get big now
Spell my name on the fridge now
With all your alphabet toys
You won the spelling bee now
But are you smarter than me now?
You're the prince of the playground
Little alphabet boy

Apples aren't always appropriate apologies
Butterscotch and bubblegum drops are bittersweet to me
You call me a child while you keep counting all your coins
But you're not my daddy and I'm not your dolly
And your dictionary's destroyed

I know my ABC's, yet you keep teaching me
I say fuck your degree, alphabet boy
You think you're smarter than me with all your bad poetry
Fuck all your ABC's, alphabet boy

I'm not a little kid now
Watch me get big now
Spell my name on the fridge now
With all your alphabet toys
You won the spelling bee now
But are you smarter than me now?
You're the prince of the playground
Little alphabet boy

Alphabet boy
Oh alphabet boy
Alphabet boy
Alphabet boy
Oh alphabet boy
Ooh-ooh

I'm not a little kid now
Watch me get big now
Spell my name on the fridge now
With all your alphabet toys
You won the spelling bee now
But are you smarter than me now?
You're the prince of the playground
Little alphabet boy
Alphabet boy
Alphabet boy
Ooh yeah
Alphabet boy

Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap

Think I just remembered something
I think I left the faucet running
Now my words are filling up the tub
Darling, you're just soaking in it
But I know you'll get out the minute
You notice all your fingers pruning up

I'm tired of being careful, tip toe, trying to keep the water warm
Let me under your skin
Uh oh there it goes, I said too much, it overflowed
Why do I always spill?

I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap

I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap

Think I got myself in trouble
So I fill the bath with bubbles
Then I'll put the towels all away
Should've never said the word "love"
Threw a toaster in the bathtub
I'm sick of all the games I have to play

I'm tired of being careful, tip toe, trying to keep the water warm
Let me under your skin
Uh oh there it goes, I said too much, it overflowed
Why do I always spill?

I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap

I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap

I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash, wash mouth, mouth with soap

I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap

Riding down, riding down
My hand on your seat
The whole way round
I carry band-aids on me now
For when your soft hands hit the jagged ground
Wheels aren't even touching the ground
Scared to take them off but they're so worn out
Promise I won't push you straight to the dirt
If you promise me you'll take them off first

I love everything you do
When you call me fucking dumb for the stupid shit I do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
I'll pull them off for you

Letting go, letting go
Telling you things you already know
I explode, I explode
Asking you where you want us to go
You've been riding two wheelers all your life
It's not like I'm asking to be your wife
I wanna make you mine, but that's hard to say
Is this coming off in a cheesy way?

I love everything you do
When you call me fucking dumb for the stupid shit I do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
I'll pull them off for you

(Everything you do)
(I wanna ride my bike with you)
(No training wheels left for you)

I love everything you do
When you call me fucking dumb for the stupid shit I do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
I'll pull them off for you

Did my invitations disappear?
Why'd I put my heart on every cursive letter?
Tell me why the hell no one is here
Tell me what to do to make it all feel better

Maybe it's a cruel joke on me
Whatever, whatever
Just means there's way more cake for me
Forever, forever

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames

Maybe if I knew all of them well
I wouldn't have been trapped inside this hell that holds me
Maybe if I casted out a spell
But told them decorations were in pastel ribbons

Maybe it's a cruel joke on me
Whatever, whatever
Just means there's way more cake for me
Forever, forever

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames

I'm laughing, I'm crying
It feels like I'm dying
I'm laughing, I'm crying
It feels like I'm dying
I'm laughing, I'm crying
It feels like I'm dying
I'm dying, I'm dying
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames

It's my party, it's-it's my party
It's my party, it's-it's my party
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry, cry, cry)

Looking at me through your window
Boy, you had your eye out for a little
"I'll cut you up and make you dinner
You've reached the end, you are the winner"

Rolling down your tinted window
Driving next to me real slow, he said
"Let me take you for a joyride
I've got some candy for you inside"

Running through the parking lot
He chased me and he wouldn't stop
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Grabbed my hand, pushed me down
Took the words right out my mouth
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Can anybody hear me? I'm hidden under ground
Can anybody hear me? Am I talking to myself?
Saying, "tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it"
He's saying, "tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it"

Little bit of poison in me
I can taste your skin in my teeth
"I love it when I hear you breathing
I hope to God you're never leaving"

Running through the parking lot
He chased me and he wouldn't stop
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Grabbed my hand, pushed me down
Took the words right out my mouth
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Can anybody hear me? I'm hidden under ground
Can anybody hear me? Am I talking to myself?
Saying, "tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it"
He's saying, "tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it"

Eenie meenie miny mo
Catch your lady by her toes
If she screams, don't let her go
Eenie meenie miny mo
Your mother said to pick the very best girl
And I am

Running through the parking lot
He chased me and he wouldn't stop
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Grabbed my hand, pushed me down
Took the words right out my mouth
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Running through the parking lot
He chased me and he wouldn't stop
Tag, you're it, tag, you're it
Grabbed my hand, pushed me down
Take the words right out my mouth
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it

1, 2, melatonin is coming for you
3, 4, baby, won't you lock the door?
5, 6, I'm done with this
7, 8, it's getting late, so close your eyes, sleep for days

Hush, little baby, drink your spoiled milk
I'm fucking crazy, need my prescription filled
Do you like my cookies? They're made just for you
A little bit of sugar, but lots of poison, too

Ashes, ashes, time to go down
Ooh, honey do you want me now?
Can't take it anymore, need to put you to bed
Sing you a lullaby where you die at the end

9, 10, never want to see you again
11, 12, I pull off black so well
Shit behind the curtain that I'm sick of sugarcoatin'
Next time you're alone, think fast when you grab the phone

Ashes, ashes, time to go down
Ooh, honey do you want me now?
Can't take it anymore, need to put you to bed
Sing you a lullaby where you die at the end

Tired, blue boy walks my way
Holding a girl's hand
That basic bitch leaves finally
Now I can take her man

Someone told me stay away from things that aren’t yours
But was he yours, if he wanted me so bad?

Pacify her
She’s getting on my nerves
You don’t love her
Stop lying with those words

I can’t stand her whining
Where’s her binky now?
And loving her seems tiring
So boy, just love me, down, down, down

Someone told me stay away from things that aren’t yours
But was he yours, if he wanted me so bad?

Pacify her
She’s getting on my nerves
You don’t love her
Stop lying with those words

Pacify her
She’s getting on my nerves
You don’t love her
Stop lying with those words

Pacify her
She’s getting on my nerves
You don’t love her
Stop lying with those words

If you weren't born with it
You can buy a couple ornaments
Just be sure to read the warning, kids
Cause pretty soon you'll be bored of it
Sexual, hey girl, if you wanna feel sexual
You can always call up a professional
They stick pins in you like a vegetable

Kids forever, kids forever
Baby soft skin turns into leather
Don't be dramatic it's only some plastic
No one will love you if you're unattractive

Oh Mrs. Potato Head, tell me, is it true that pain is beauty?
Does a new face come with a warranty?
Will a pretty face make it better?
Oh Mr. Potato Head, tell me, how did you afford her surgery?
Do you swear you'll stay forever?
Even if her face don't stay together
Even if her face don't stay together

If you want a little more confidence
Potatoes turn to french fries, yeah it's common sense
All you need's a couple more condiments
And a hundred thousand dollars for some compliments
It's such a waste
When little girls grow into their mother's face
But little girls are learning how to cut and paste
And pucker up their lips until they suffocate

Kids forever, kids forever
Baby soft skin turns into leather
Don't be dramatic it's only some plastic
No one will love you if you're unattractive

Oh Mrs. Potato Head, tell me, is it true that pain is beauty?
Does a new face come with a warranty?
Will a pretty face make it better?
Oh Mr. Potato Head, tell me, how did you afford her surgery?
Do you swear you'll stay forever?
Even if her face don't stay together
Stay forever, stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together
Stay forever, stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together

Oh Mrs. Potato Head, tell me, is it true that pain is beauty?
Does a new face come with a warranty?
Will a pretty face make it better?
Oh Mr. Potato Head, tell me, how did you afford her surgery?
Do you swear you'll stay forever?

Even if her face don't stay together
Stay forever, stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together
Stay forever, stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together
Stay forever, stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together
Stay forever, stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together

My friends don't walk, they run
Skinny dip in rabbit holes for fun
Poppin', poppin' balloons with guns
Getting high off helium
We paint white roses red
Each shade from a different persons' head
And in this dream there is a killer
Getting drunk with the blue caterpillar

Now I'm peeling the skin off my face
Cause I really hate being safe
The normals, they make me afraid
The crazies, they make me feel sane

I'm nuts, baby, I'm mad
The craziest friend that you've ever had
You think I'm psycho, you think I'm gone
Tell the psychiatrist something is wrong
Over the bend, entirely bonkers
You like me best when I'm off my rocker
Tell you a secret, I'm not alarmed
So what if I'm crazy? The best people are
All the best people are crazy
All the best people are

Where is my prescription?
Doctor, doctor, please listen
My brain is scattered
You can be Alice, I'll be the Mad Hatter

Now I'm peeling the skin off my face
Cause I really hate being safe
The normals, they make me afraid
The crazy, they make me feel sane

I'm nuts, baby, I'm mad
The craziest friend that you've ever had
You think I'm psycho, you think I'm gone
Tell the psychiatrist something is wrong
Over the bend, entirely bonkers
You like me best when I'm off my rocker
Tell you a secret, I'm not alarmed
So what if I'm crazy? The best people are
All the best people are crazy
All the best people are

You think I'm crazy, you think I'm gone
So what if I'm crazy? All the best people are
And I think you're crazy too, I know you're gone
It's probably the reason that we get along

I'm nuts, baby, I'm mad
The craziest friend that you've ever had
You think I'm psycho, you think I'm gone
Tell the psychiatrist something is wrong
Over the bend, entirely bonkers
You like me best when I'm off my rocker
Tell you a secret, I'm not alarmed
So what if I'm crazy? The best people are
All the best people are crazy
All the best people are

You call me on the telephone, you feel so far away
You tell me to come over there's some games you want to play
I'm walking to your house, nobody's home
It's just me and you, you and me alone

We're just playing hide and seek
It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you
I don't want to play no games
I'm tired of always chasing, chasing after you

I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Whoever said I give a shit about you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you

Wake up in your bedroom and there's nothing left to say
When I try to talk you're always playing board games
I wish I had monopoly over your mind
I wish I didn't care all the time

We're just playing hide and seek
It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you
I don't want to play no games
I'm tired of always chasing, chasing after you

I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Whoever said I give a shit about you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you

Ring around the rosy
I never know, I never know what you need
Ring around the rosy, I want to give you, want to give you
What you need

I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Whoever said I give a shit about you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you

You know I give a fuck about you everyday
Guess it's time that I tell you the truth
If I share my toys, will you let me stay?
Don't want to leave this play date with you

Stitched you up, put you together
With cotton and feather
Gave you love, put my heart inside you
Oh what could I do
When you started talking in your sleep
Saying things you'd do to me
I didn't care
I wasn't scared
Now I'm finding knives under the sheets
Crumbled photographs of me
I'm in despair
Should I be scared?

Teddy bear, you are my teddy bear
You were comforting and quiet
How did love become so violent?
Oh, teddy bear, you were my teddy bear
Everything was so sweet until you tried to kill me

I threw you out, I didn't outgrow you
I just didn't know you
But now you're back
And it's so terrifying how you paralyze me
Now you showing up inside my home
Breathing deep into the phone
I'm so unprepared
I'm fucking scared

Teddy bear, you are my teddy bear
You were comforting and quiet
How did love become so violent?
Teddy bear, you were my teddy bear
Everything was so sweet until you tried to kill me

I'm fucking scared

Teddy bear, you are my teddy bear
You were comforting and quiet
How did love become so violent?
Teddy bear, you were my teddy bear
Everything was so sweet until you tried to kill me

Your skin is warm like an oven, your kiss is sugary sweet
Your fingers feel like cotton when you put your arms around me
I feel like I'm just missing something whenever you leave
You've got all the ingredients except you loving me
And respectfully

I'm not a piece of cake for you to just discard
While you walk away with the frosting of my heart
So I'm taking back what's mine, you'll miss
The slice of heaven that I gave to you last night

You smell just like vanilla, you taste like buttercream
You're filling up my senses with empty calories
I feel like I’m just missing something whenever you leave
You've got all the ingredients except you needing me
So respectfully

I’m not a piece of cake for you to just discard
While you walk away with the frosting of my heart
So I’m taking back what’s mine, you’ll miss
The slice of heaven that I gave to you last night

If I am just a piece of cake
I am just a piece of cake
Then, you're just a piece of meat
You're just a piece of meat to me
If I am just a piece of cake
I am just a piece of cake
Then, you're just a piece of meat
You're just a piece of meat to me

I’m not a piece of cake for you to just discard
While you walk away with the frosting of my heart
So I’m taking back what's mine, you'll miss
The slice of heaven that I gave to you last night
